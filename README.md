# scripts_mpqb_ohc

The folder contains many files. 

single_month_ohc.py is the script used to calculate the vertical integrals of temperature for each month and each year.

thetao_metrics_mpqb.py  and time_analysis.py are the main scripts containing all the diagnostic used to produce figures for the report (the plotting parts have been slightly modified case to case to adapt to data variabilities.

The other files are used to construct the trend part basically, and to plot maps.

There's also an ancillary file (it was the initial idea but then was not used anymore which does the metrics calculation for different units of measurement).
