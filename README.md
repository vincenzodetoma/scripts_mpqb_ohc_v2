# scripts_mpqb_ohc

This branch is devoted to the development of the code, and when it will be finished it will be added to the master branch. 

This repository contains the metrics developed in python for the assessment of the ocean heat content variable as part of the multi-product-quality brief for the copernicus climate change service.
This I hope will help to keep track of the code developed in this phase of the project.
